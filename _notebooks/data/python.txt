## 🧠 Basic Syntax Example

Here’s a quick example to get a feel for Python:

```python
# Simple Python Program

name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to Python Programming.")

# Arithmetic Example
a = 10
b = 5
print("Sum:", a + b)
print("Product:", a * b)
```

Output:
```
Enter your name: Bibhu
Hello, Bibhu! Welcome to Python Programming.
Sum: 15
Product: 50
```

## 🧰 Best Practices for Python Developers

- Use **meaningful variable names**.
- Follow **PEP 8** (Python Enhancement Proposal) coding style.
- Leverage **virtual environments** to manage dependencies.
- Write **unit tests** for maintainability.
- Use **list comprehensions** and **generators** for cleaner code.

Example:

```python
# Using list comprehension
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
print(squares)
```
