# 🤖 Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** that enables systems to learn and improve automatically from experience without being explicitly programmed. In simple terms, ML allows computers to **find patterns** in data and **make predictions** or **decisions** based on it.

## 🚀 Why Machine Learning?

We live in a data-driven world. Every click, purchase, and interaction generates data. Machine Learning helps us extract **insights**, **detect trends**, and **automate decisions** from this massive amount of information.

Some examples of ML in real life:

- 🎬 Netflix recommending movies
- 🛒 Amazon suggesting products
- 🧠 Google Photos recognizing faces
- 🚗 Tesla enabling self-driving features
- 🏦 Banks detecting fraudulent transactions

## 🧩 Types of Machine Learning

Machine Learning can be categorized into three main types:

### 1. **Supervised Learning**
The model is trained on labeled data — meaning the correct answer is known in advance.

Examples:
- Predicting house prices (`regression`)
- Classifying emails as spam or not spam (`classification`)

Popular algorithms: **Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

### 2. **Unsupervised Learning**
The model works on **unlabeled data**, discovering patterns or groupings on its own.

Examples:
- Customer segmentation
- Market basket analysis

Popular algorithms: **K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA**

### 3. **Reinforcement Learning**
Here, an agent learns by interacting with its environment to achieve a goal. It receives **rewards** or **penalties** based on actions.

Examples:
- Game-playing AI (like AlphaGo)
- Robotics and autonomous driving

Popular algorithms: **Q-Learning, Deep Q-Network (DQN)**

## 💡 How Machine Learning Works

The general workflow of an ML project:

1. **Data Collection** – Gather raw data from various sources.  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Clean and prepare data (handling missing values, scaling, etc.).  
3. **Model Training** – Choose an algorithm and feed it training data.  
4. **Model Evaluation** – Test performance using unseen data.  
5. **Model Deployment** – Integrate the model into production for real-world use.

## 💻 Example: Predicting House Prices

Here’s a simple Python example using **scikit-learn**:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Training Data (square feet vs price)
X = np.array([[1000], [1500], [2000], [2500], [3000]])
y = np.array([150000, 200000, 250000, 300000, 350000])

# Create and train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict price for a 2200 sq ft house
predicted_price = model.predict([[2200]])
print(f"Predicted Price: ${predicted_price[0]:,.2f}")
```

Output:
```
Predicted Price: $275,000.00
```

## 🧰 Best Practices in ML Development

- Collect **quality data**, not just large data.  
- Avoid **data leakage** during training and testing.  
- Use **cross-validation** to prevent overfitting.  
- Track experiments with tools like **MLflow**.  
- Regularly **retrain models** with new data.
