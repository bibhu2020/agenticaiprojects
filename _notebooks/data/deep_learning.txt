# 🧠 Introduction to Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a powerful subset of **Machine Learning (ML)** that mimics how the human brain processes information. It uses **neural networks** with multiple layers to automatically learn complex patterns and representations from large datasets.

## 🚀 What is Deep Learning?

At its core, Deep Learning involves training **artificial neural networks (ANNs)** to perform tasks such as classification, detection, and prediction. Unlike traditional ML algorithms that rely on manual feature extraction, Deep Learning models can **automatically learn features** from raw data like images, text, or audio.

## 🔍 Why Deep Learning Matters

Deep Learning has revolutionized modern AI applications, enabling breakthroughs such as:

- 🗣️ Speech recognition (e.g., Siri, Alexa)  
- 📸 Image recognition (e.g., Google Photos, facial recognition)  
- 🧠 Natural language processing (e.g., ChatGPT, translation apps)  
- 🚗 Autonomous vehicles  
- 🩺 Medical image analysis  

These systems are powered by **neural networks** trained on vast datasets with millions of parameters.

## 🧩 The Structure of a Neural Network

A **neural network** consists of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons):

1. **Input Layer** – Accepts raw data.  
2. **Hidden Layers** – Perform mathematical transformations to learn patterns.  
3. **Output Layer** – Produces predictions or classifications.

Each neuron performs a weighted sum of inputs followed by an **activation function** that introduces non-linearity.

### Example Formula
```
y = activation(Wx + b)
```
where:  
- `W` = weights  
- `x` = input  
- `b` = bias  
- `activation` = function like ReLU, sigmoid, or tanh

| Component | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Neural Networks** | Foundation of Deep Learning; interconnected layers of neurons. |
| **Activation Functions** | Introduce non-linearity (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid). |
| **Loss Function** | Measures how far predictions are from actual values. |
| **Backpropagation** | Algorithm to update weights by minimizing loss. |
| **Optimization Algorithms** | Techniques like SGD and Adam for faster convergence. |

## 💻 Example: Image Classification with Keras

Here’s a simple Deep Learning example using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

# Load dataset
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()

# Normalize and preprocess data
X_train, X_test = X_train / 255.0, X_test / 255.0
y_train, y_test = to_categorical(y_train), to_categorical(y_test)

# Build neural network model
model = Sequential([
    Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile and train
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

# Evaluate
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```

Output:
```
Test Accuracy: 0.98
```

This model can classify handwritten digits (0–9) from the **MNIST dataset** with high accuracy.
