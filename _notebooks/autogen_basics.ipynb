    "# Autogen\n",
    "- Microsoft \"Autogen 0.4\" released on Jan, 2025.\n",
    "- Google Developers (after leaving Microsoft in 2024) forked the project \"Autogen 0.2\" and created a google version called \"AgentOS 2 or AG2\".\n",
    "- Microsoft Autogen discord has also been taken over by the Google AG2 team.\n",
    "- **Also to note**, \"pip install autogen\" installs AG2 (not Autogen).\n",
    "- Google developer has **hijacked the pip library and discord** causing confusion for the new learner trying to use Microsoft Autogen.\n",

    "- **AutoGen Core** is a event-driven framework for scalable multi-agent AI systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **AutoGen AgentChat** is a lightweight abstraction on top of the **AutoGen Core** that puts together LLMs in a Agent construct to allow them use tools and interact with each others.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Studio** is an abstract on top of **AutoGen AgentChat** to build low-code/no-code app for research work mostly today.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Magnetic One CLI** is an abstract on top of **AutoGen AgentChat** for build command-line assistant.\n",

    "## AutoGen Core Concepts\n",

    "- **Models** - represents the llm.\n",
    "    ```py\n",

    "    model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Messages** - Represents message / event between the agents. \n",

    "- **Teams** - A group of agents to achieve some goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes:\n",
    "- Unlike openai and langchain, you do not need to decorate a function to make it act like a tool. You can pass any function to Agent's tool list."
